this is a toy project that will eventually generate an NFT collection with provided layered assets

at first it will just generate the collection, but eventually I will try to hook it up to the Etherium network.

todo:

class that will represent the NFT
    head, mouth, eyes, nose, hat, facial hair

    start with strings + a number
    and then we will figure out use images



choose random assets to make a char


figure out rarity model


figure out how to hook up to Etherium network


write a smart contract
